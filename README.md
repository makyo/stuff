## Hey, Makyo's got some stuff you can maybe borrow or buy or whatever

### Audio Equipment

Digital audio recorder with XLR- and RCA-in with phantom power, plus four mics (two cardioid, two omnidirectional). Records to SD/SDHC Lots of features.

Digital audio recorder with XLR- and RCA-in for four channels with phantom power. Pairs well with camera, and includes male and female tripod mounts. Records to SD/SDHC or back up to camera, or pass-through to computer. Mixing features abound.

#### 2x MXL V67G mics

Two vocal or room mics. Cardioid with low noise floor. XLR requiring phantom power. Includes shock mounts.

#### Blue Microphones Yeti mic

Versatile desktop or stand USB mic supporting directional, stereo, or cardioid patterns. Good for podcasts. Includes shock mount and pop filter

#### Boom stand

Standard mount boom stand, including dual-head mount for e.g: both MXL mics.

#### Desktop boom stand

Short (12" ish) boom stand with heavy bass for setting on a desk, or on the floor by drums. Good for podcasts. Will need a shock mount for mics.

#### 6x XLR cables

What it says on the tin.

#### Audio-focused laptop

Comes with Reason+Record, Sibelius, Audacity, etc. on the Win10 side, Audacity and Frescobaldi on the Ubuntu side.

### Photo/Video

#### Canon T4i

Simple, powerful, easy to use DSLR body for photo or video. Lenses separate, remote and charger included. Fits Canon EF lenses, more with converters.

#### Canon Speedlite 430EX II

Pretty good flash. Talks well with the camera, but has extra programming from the back. Optionally, comes with corded remote base with additional shoe, also works with flash syncing on the camera body if you need more space. Also available is a bounce, including white, gold, and silver inserts.

#### Canon Lens EF 40mm f/2.8 STM

Good short prime with very quiet focus, manual or auto. Macro to 0.3m/0.98ft.

#### Canon mount LensBaby Composer Pro

LensBaby base with simple swivel and focus in the body.

#### Canon mount LensBaby Control Freak

Ridiculous fucking lens working by squeezing to tilt and focus, after which you lock in the lens, making fine-tuned adjustments with screws. Super fun, crazy difficult.

#### LensBaby lens inserts

LensBabies use swappable inserts to change the look and feel of the resulting picture. I have a lot. They all work with both bodies.

* *Double glass:* circular sweet-spot of focus, f-stop controlled by inserts (included)
* *Single glass:* same as above but with harder drop-off in focus. Wilier to use. Inserts for f-stop (included)
* *Plastic lens:* same as single glass but with a plastic lens, leading to weird/cool aberrations. Inserts for f-stop (included)
* *Pinhole/zone plate:* turns camera into a pinhole or zone plate camera via a switch within the lens. This is very difficult to use.
* *Soft focus:* nicer version of the double glass insert using a soft focus ring (big center whole, with lots of smaller holes in a ring around it, leading to different bits of light coming in). Good for macro stuff.
* *Edge 80:* 80mm f/2.8 full lens with macro capability via a pull-out ring, with linear focus (think tilt-shift)
* *Macro converters:* 8mm, 16mm, stackable for greater macroing

#### Camera bag

Kinda beat to shit, but I love this thing. Super flexable with velcro inserts and pockets everywhere.

#### Olypmus OM-D E-M5 Mark II kit

This is my main kit and I'm really attached to it, but if you want to work with it, let me know.

* OM-D E-M5 Mark II body. Fits &mu;4/3 lenses. Sweeeet.
* HLD-8 grip/vertical grip with controls/secondary battery holder.
* Olympus M. Zuiko 45mm f/1.8 AF lens. Good portrait lens (90mm full frame equiv.)
* Olympus 17mm f/1.8 MF/AF lens. Dedicated MF through a pull-back ring. Good wide or macro lens (0.25m/0.82ft)
