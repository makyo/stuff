## Hey, Makyo's got some stuff you can maybe borrow or buy or whatever

### Audio Equipment

#### Tascam DR-100mkII

Digital audio recorder with XLR- and RCA-in with phantom power, plus four mics (two cardioid, two omnidirectional). Records to SD/SDHC Lots of features.

#### Tascam DR-60DmkII

Digital audio recorder with XLR- and RCA-in for four channels with phantom power. Pairs well with camera, and includes male and female tripod mounts. Records to SD/SDHC or back up to camera, or pass-through to computer. Mixing features abound.

#### Behringer XENYX X1222USB studio mixer

12 Channel 16-input studio mixer with pre-amps, compressors, EQ, and FX processor, connects through USB to a computer for in/out.

#### 2x MXL V67G mics

Two vocal or room mics. Cardioid with low noise floor. XLR requiring phantom power. Includes shock mounts.

#### CAD Equitek E100S

Another good vocal mic, good for up-close vocals or podcasting, if you're willing to deal with XLR and phantom power. Built in shock-mount's pretty nice, too; pop filter available.

#### Blue Microphones Yeti mic

Versatile desktop or stand USB mic supporting omni, stereo, or cardioid patterns. Good for podcasts. Includes shock mount and pop filter

#### CAD GXL2600usb

Another good podcast/vocals mic, but one that requires a good bit of setup, which I can show you. Includes desktop stand, shock mount; pop filter available.

#### Boom stand

Standard mount boom stand, including dual-head mount for e.g: both MXL mics.

#### Desktop boom stand

Short (12" ish) boom stand with heavy bass for setting on a desk, or on the floor by drums. Good for podcasts. Will need a shock mount for mics.

#### 6x XLR cables

What it says on the tin.

#### Audio-focused laptop

Comes with Reason+Record, Sibelius, Audacity, etc. on the Win10 side, Audacity and Frescobaldi on the Ubuntu side.

### Photo/Video

#### Canon T4i

Simple, powerful, easy to use DSLR body for photo or video. Lenses separate, remote and charger included. Fits Canon EF lenses, more with converters.

#### Canon Speedlite 430EX II

Pretty good flash. Talks well with the camera, but has extra programming from the back. Optionally, comes with corded remote base with additional shoe, also works with flash syncing on the camera body if you need more space. Also available is a bounce, including white, gold, and silver inserts.

#### Canon Lens EF 40mm f/2.8 STM

Good short prime with very quiet focus, manual or auto. Macro to 0.3m/0.98ft.

#### Canon mount LensBaby Composer Pro

LensBaby base with simple swivel and focus in the body.

#### Canon mount LensBaby Control Freak

Ridiculous fucking lens working by squeezing to tilt and focus, after which you lock in the lens, making fine-tuned adjustments with screws. Super fun, crazy difficult.

#### LensBaby lens inserts

LensBabies use swappable inserts to change the look and feel of the resulting picture. I have a lot. They all work with both bodies.

* *Double glass:* circular sweet-spot of focus, f-stop controlled by inserts (included)
* *Single glass:* same as above but with harder drop-off in focus. Wilier to use. Inserts for f-stop (included)
* *Plastic lens:* same as single glass but with a plastic lens, leading to weird/cool aberrations. Inserts for f-stop (included)
* *Pinhole/zone plate:* turns camera into a pinhole or zone plate camera via a switch within the lens. This is very difficult to use.
* *Soft focus:* nicer version of the double glass insert using a soft focus ring (big center whole, with lots of smaller holes in a ring around it, leading to different bits of light coming in). Good for macro stuff.
* *Edge 80:* 80mm f/2.8 full lens with macro capability via a pull-out ring, with linear focus (think tilt-shift)
* *Macro converters:* 8mm, 16mm, stackable for greater macroing

#### Camera bag

Kinda beat to shit, but I love this thing. Super flexable with velcro inserts and pockets everywhere.

#### Olypmus OM-D E-M5 Mark II kit

This is my main kit and I'm really attached to it, but if you want to work with it, let me know.

* OM-D E-M5 Mark II body. Fits &mu;4/3 lenses. Sweeeet.
* HLD-8 grip/vertical grip with controls/secondary battery holder.
* Olympus M. Zuiko 45mm f/1.8 AF lens. Good portrait lens (90mm full frame equiv.)
* Olympus 17mm f/1.8 MF/AF lens. Dedicated MF through a pull-back ring. Good wide or macro lens (0.25m/0.82ft)

### Kitchen stuff

#### Kitchenaid Artisan Stand Mixer

Your standard bubbly-looking Kitchenaid mixer. This is the artisan one, where the top lifts up, not the industrial one where the bowl lowers. Super dependable, though. Comes with dough hook, mixing paddle, and whisk attachments.

#### Kitchenaid Mixer Attachments

I think these attachments fit any Kitchenaid stand mixer with the front attachment.

* *Food grinder:* think sausage grinder. Does well with grinding meat and veg. Can work as a juicer in a pinch with cheesecloth over a bowl.
* *Grain mill:* works for non-oily dry grains. Good for brewing, but note that the small hopper means you'll need to be there with a scoop.

#### [Ascaso Dream](http://www.ascaso.com/div-espresso-coffee-machines-grinders/dream-1.html) Espresso Machine

A really quite nice countertop espresso machine. Single boiler, temperature gauge (not the PID model), portafilter, tamp. Good stuff, though I alternate between this, Chemex, and Moka pot, so it's borrow-able. Has a steam wand, natch, but since it's a single boiler model, you have to either wait for the boiler to cool down for espresso and let your milk cool down as well, or run the shot and wait for the boiler to heat up for steaming, which means letting your shot die :P Best way around it I've found is to steam and then put your steamed milk in the microwave (not on, just for thermal insulation) while you run your shot.

#### Bamboo steamer baskets

I dunno, if you want :D
